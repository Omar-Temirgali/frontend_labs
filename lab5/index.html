            <p id ="myP">Beginning with early Atari and Nintendo video games, 
                the 8-bit aesthetic has been a part of our culture for over 30 years. 
                As it moved through the generations, 8-bit earned its independence from its 
                video game roots. The idea of 8-bit now stands for a refreshing level of simplicity and 
                minimalism, is capable of sonic and visual beauty, and points to the layer of 
                technology that suffuses our modern lives. No longer just nostalgia art, 
                contemporary 8-bit artists and chiptunes musicians have elevated the form to new levels 
                of creativity and cultural reflection.</p>
